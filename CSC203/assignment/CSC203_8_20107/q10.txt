Who says, who says youre not perfect?
We keep this love in a photograph
Who says youre not worth it?
We made these memories For ourselves
Who says youre the only one thats hurting?
Where our eyes are never closing
Trust me, thats the price of beauty
Hearts are never broken, and time forever frozen still
Who says youre not pretty?
So you can keep me
Who says youre not beautiful?
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer until our eyes meet
You wont ever be alone
